# Shared components

Buttons are stateles. This allows us to create a component that can be used in a variety of ways. For example, a button component can be used as a button, a link, or a menu item. The button component can be used in a variety of ways, but the button component itself is not aware of how it is being used. This is a good thing.

In typescript. React.FC means react functional component. It checks for static properties and children.

Prop spreading can help extend the component. For example, if we want to add a className or ID to the button, we can do so by using the spread operator or use aria labels. This avoids prop sheets.
